    <h1>Star Wars Data Cleaning &amp; Exploratory Analysis</h1>
    <p><img src="./index.png" alt="A bar chart"></p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>An analysis of user survey data related to the Star Wars film franchise (based on FiveThirtyEight data and a
        dataquest.io project). This analysis required a good amount of survey data cleaning and some basic matplotlib 
        techniques.</p>

    <p>This analysis found some interesting insights:
    <ul>
        <li>Jar Jar Binks is more hated than Darth Vader</li>
        <li>The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are the most-viewed films of the franchise.</li>
        <li>The group that liked the much-maligned The Phantom Menace the best is those in the 60+ age range.</li>
        <li>Household income appeared to have no relationship with viewership or ratings.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
