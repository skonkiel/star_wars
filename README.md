An analysis of user survey data related to the Star Wars film franchise (based on FiveThirtyEight data and a dataquest.io project).

This analysis found some interesting insights:
* Jar Jar Binks is more hated than Darth Vader
* The group that rates the much-maligned _The Phantom Menace_ the highest is actually those in the 60+ age range.
* _The Empire Strikes Back_ and _Return of the Jedi_ are the most-viewed films of the franchise.
* Household income appeared to have no relationship with viewership or ratings.
