# star_wars
An analysis of user survey data related to the Star Wars film franchise (based on [FiveThirtyEight data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) and a dataquest.io project). This analysis required a good amount of survey data cleaning and some basic `matplotlib` techniques.

This analysis found some interesting insights:
* Jar Jar Binks is more hated than Darth Vader
* _The Empire Strikes Back_ and _Return of the Jedi_ are the most-viewed films of the franchise.
* The group that liked the much-maligned _The Phantom Menace_ the best is those in the 60+ age range.
* Household income appeared to have no relationship with viewership or ratings.
